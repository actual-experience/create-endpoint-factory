# Endpoint

An endpoint instance describes an individual API route, and its handling of requests by HTTP method.

It is returned from calling a [factory](./factory) (called `createEndpoint` in this documentation).

```ts no-transpile
export const endpoint = createEndpoint({
  methods: (method) => ({
    get: method({
      handler: () => 'foo',
    }),
  }),
});

export default endpoint.handler;
```

## Configuration

The endpoint can be configured to affect the final behaviour of the route handler.

### Method handling

The main way of defining an endpoint's behaviour is by creating [method](./method) definitions. This is created with a callback receiving a builder object, and returning an object with each definition under its corresponding method.

```ts no-transpile
export const endpoint = createEndpoint({
  // highlight-start
  methods: (method) => ({
    get: method({
      handler: () => 'foo',
    }),
  }),
  // highlight-end
});
```

### Default handler

By default, an endpoint will respond to an unrecognised method request by setting the `Allow` header to a list of supported methods, and setting the status to `405`.

If you wish to replace this behaviour, you can provide a `default` handler:

```ts no-transpile
export const endpoint = createEndpoint({
  methods: (method) => ({
    get: method({
      handler: () => 'foo',
    }),
  }),
  // highlight-start
  default: (method) =>
    method({
      handler: (req, res, { failWithCode }) => {
        res.setHeader('Allow', 'GET');
        throw new failWithCode(405, 'Unrecognised method');
      },
    }),
  // highlight-end
});
```

### Handler decoration

<!-- TODO: Decorator -> Enhancer? -->

It's a fairly common pattern to create a function that receives a NextJS handler and returns a new handler wrapping it. CEF supports this via decorators.

```ts no-transpile
import type { NextApiHandler } from 'next';
import { createEndpoint, withAuth, withFoo } from '../../src/api';

export const endpoint = createEndpoint({
  methods: () => ({}),
  decorators: [withFoo, withAuth],
});

export default endpoint.handler;
```

:::info
Decorators will be called from right to left, meaning that `withAuth` will receive the original handler, and `withFoo` will receive the handler that `withAuth` returns.

This means that the above is equivalent to:

```ts no-transpile
import type { NextApiHandler } from 'next';
import { createEndpoint, withAuth, withFoo } from '../../src/api';

export const endpoint = createEndpoint({
  methods: () => ({}),
});

export default withFoo(withAuth(endpoint.handler));
```

_However, this approach doesn't decorate the included [individual method handlers](#individual-method-handlers), only the [combined handler](#combined-handler)._

:::

:::caution
Each decorator is expected to take one parameter, the handler. If the original wrapper needs extra parameters, for example configuration, then a secondary function would be necessary.

```ts
// file: src/api/index.ts noEmit
import type { NextApiHandler } from 'next';
import { createEndpointFactory } from 'next-create-endpoint-factory';

export const createEndpoint = createEndpointFactory();

export const withFoo = (handler: NextApiHandler, config: { bar: boolean }) =>
  handler;

// file: pages/api/foo.ts
import type { NextApiHandler } from 'next';
import { createEndpoint, withFoo } from '../../src/api';

export const endpoint = createEndpoint({
  methods: () => ({}),
  decorators: [(handler: NextApiHandler) => withFoo(handler, { bar: true })],
});
```

:::

## Instance

Calling the factory function with configuration will return an object with a collection of useful handlers attached.

### Combined handler

The endpoint handler (`handler` on the instance returned) combines all of the method definitions and (if provided) default into a final handler which will automatically execute the correct method definition based on the request method (or [default behaviour](#default-handler) if method is unsupported).

:::tip

This is usually what you'll want to export as default from your API route file.

```ts no-transpile
export default endpoint.handler;
```

:::

### Individual method handlers

For each defined method, the final endpoint instance will have a handler attached under the `methods` key. For example, if you only had a GET handler defined, then there would be a handler defined for `endpoints.methods.get`.

### Default handler

If a [default](#default-handler) is defined, a wrapped handler for this will be attached as `endpoint.default`.
