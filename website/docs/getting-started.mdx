# Getting Started

## Introduction

Create Endpoint Factory (CEF) is a utility written to make the process of creating a NextJS API route handler quicker and more type-safe.

It allows you to define a handler per HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) and consolidates them into a final handler which will call the according method, or return a 405 response if the method is unsupported (unless a default handler is provided).

It also provides some handy abstractions around returning data/catching errors.

### Features

- One time authentication setup (with the ability to disable for a given route)
- Automatic handling of unsupported methods and `OPTIONS` requests
- Automatic status code based on handler return
- Customisable serialisation of uncaught errors
- Customisable derivation of extra data from request
- Validation of body, query params and/or response

## Installation

CEF is available as a package on NPM:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
npm install next-create-endpoint-factory
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add next-create-endpoint-factory
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setup

The main export from CEF is the `createEndpointFactory` function, which is used to make the prepared `createEndpoint` [factory](/concepts/factory) used for each NextJS API route.

:::note
You're able to name this returned factory anything you like - in this documentation we'll be using `createEndpoint`.

The framework also doesn't mind where you export this factory from, as long as you're happy importing it into your API routes.
:::

```ts no-transpile
import { createEndpointFactory } from 'next-create-endpoint-factory';

export const createEndpoint = createEndpointFactory();
```

This function can optionally accept some configuration, covered in [concepts](concepts/factory#configuration).

Once this `createEndpoint` function is created, you can import it into your API route.

## Endpoints

At its base level, an endpoint defines handlers for incoming method requests.

These handlers may return data that should be sent as a response, and the final status will be set based on this.

import HandleTable from './_handle-table.mdx';

<HandleTable />

:::tip

See [custom codes](concepts/method#custom-codes) for how to use codes other than these defaults.

:::

The final combined handler will be attached to the [endpoint instance](/concepts/endpoint). In the vast majority of cases, you'll want to export this as default.

The combined handler receives the request, and automatically calls the corresponding handler - if no handler is found for the method, a `405` is sent along with an `Allow` header set to a list of supported methods.

This handler also automatically supports `OPTIONS` requests.

```ts title="pages/api/foo.ts"
// file: src/api/index.ts noEmit
import { createEndpointFactory } from 'next-create-endpoint-factory';

export const createEndpoint = createEndpointFactory();

// file: pages/api/foo.ts

import { createEndpoint } from '../../src/api';

const endpoint = createEndpoint({
  methods: ({ method }) => ({
    get: method<string>({
      handler: () => {
        return 'foo';
      },
    }),
    post: method<void>({
      handler: (req, res) => {
        console.log(req.body);
        if (!req.body) {
          throw new Error('no body');
        }
      },
    }),
  }),
});

export default endpoint.handler;
```
