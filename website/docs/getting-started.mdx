# Getting Started

## Installation

CEF is available as a package on NPM:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
npm install next-create-endpoint-factory
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add next-create-endpoint-factory
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setup

The main export from CEF is the `createEndpointFactory` function, which is used to make the prepared `createEndpoint` utility used for each NextJS API route.

:::note
You're able to name this returned function anything you like - in this documentation we'll be using `createEndpoint`.

The framework also doesn't mind where you export this function from, as long as you're happy importing it into your API routes.
:::

```ts no-transpile
import { createEndpointFactory } from 'next-create-endpoint-factory';

export const createEndpoint = createEndpointFactory();
```

This function can optionally accept some configuration, which will be covered later.

Once this `createEndpoint` function is created, you can import it into your API route.

## Endpoints

At its base level, an endpoint defines handlers for incoming method requests.

These handlers may return data that should be sent as a response, and the final status will be set based on this.

- If data is returned, the status is set to `200` and the data is sent via `res.json()`.

- If no data is returned, the status is set to `204`, and `res.end()` is called.

- If an error is thrown, the status is set to `500`, and a serialised version of the error is sent via `res.json()`.

```ts
// file: src/api/index.ts noEmit
import { createEndpointFactory } from 'next-create-endpoint-factory';

export const createEndpoint = createEndpointFactory();

// file: pages/api/foo.ts

import { createEndpoint } from '../../src/api';

const endpoint = createEndpoint({
  methods: ({ method }) => ({
    get: method<string>({
      handler: () => {
        return 'foo';
      },
    }),
    post: method<void>({
      handler: (req, res) => {
        console.log(req.body);
        if (!req.body) {
          throw new Error('no body');
        }
      },
    }),
  }),
});

export default endpoint.handler;
```

:::tip
In cases where you want to use a different status code, you can use the `failWithCode` and `succeedWithCode` utilities provided as part of the `handlerApi` object (third parameter for handler callback).

```ts
// file: src/api/index.ts noEmit
import { createEndpointFactory } from 'next-create-endpoint-factory';

export const createEndpoint = createEndpointFactory();

// file: pages/api/foo.ts

import { createEndpoint } from '../../src/api';

const endpoint = createEndpoint({
  methods: ({ method }) => ({
    post: method<{ created: true }>({
      handler: (req, res, { failWithCode, succeedWithCode }) => {
        console.log(req.body);
        if (!req.body) {
          throw failWithCode(400, 'No body provided');
        }
        return succeedWithCode(201, { created: true });
      },
    }),
  }),
});

export default endpoint.handler;
```

`failWithCode` can be returned or thrown, but it's generally better to throw it yourself.
