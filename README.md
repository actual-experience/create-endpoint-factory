# create-endpoint-factory

A utility for creating API route handlers for NextJS apps.

See https://actual-experience.github.io/create-endpoint-factory/ for more details.

## NOTE

The package is not currently published to NPM, as [#4](https://github.com/actual-experience/create-endpoint-factory/pull/4) presents a fairly significant breaking change to the API format and I'd rather publish once this is finalised.
