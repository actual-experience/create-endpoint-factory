# create-endpoint-factory

A utility for creating API route handlers for NextJS apps.

See https://actual-experience.github.io/create-endpoint-factory/ for more details.

## NOTE

The package is not currently published to NPM, as #3 presents a fairly significant breaking change to the API format and I'd rather publish once this is finalised.
